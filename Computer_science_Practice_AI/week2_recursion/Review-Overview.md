# Recursion

- Recursion always has a base case so the branch of calls can return its way back up
- it has a limit as well (look at sys.getrecursionlimit()) to see
- doing recursion is not as memory heavy but will increase the call stack becauses each one will make a new stack

# things i couldnt understand

- fibonacci was a little weird as i just didnt understand the core concept but i knew how recursion worked
- so it would be helpful to write out the problems more and look for better understanding on the problem so i don't hit a road block
