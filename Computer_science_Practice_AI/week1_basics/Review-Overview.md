What was easy?
"Thinking on what the function needed to do and how to do so was pretty easy. The logic wasnt too hard and i could easily depict what needed to happen and what the output would look like."

What was frustrating or confusing?
"The thing that was confusing was the [] operator on strings as i didn't know how they worked so it made the project more interseing but challenging.\n 
Another thing that i was liking to think about was how maximum was acheived by keeping a local varable"

What did I learn about my habits (do I freeze when I start typing code, etc.)?
"When I'm writinig code i tend to think in advance on the solution which could be worked on. It would be better if i broke down problems more and depicted them more and drew outlines or diagrams. \n
I also do look stuff up when writing code when i don't know how to do soemtihng or i dont fully know how something works then i write a comment in the code to explain what i picked up."

Write one “semantic” or new trick you discovered (for your CS Playbook).
"I learned how the [] operator works, it has three inputs that it takes ([_,_,_]) the first is the start index and then the second is the end index so if i wanted to get the second and third letter i would
put 1,2 now i do need to see if thats inclusive but that could be fiqured out by little tests. Then the third spot is for the pace or steps it will take. so i could have it go for every two letters or have it go backwards
by using -1."

- In Python, strings are indexed from 0 and are immutable (any operation like slicing creates a new string).
- The slicing operator [start:end:step]:
  - start = where to begin (default 0)
  - end = where to stop (default end of string)
  - step = how much to move each time (can be negative for reverse)
  Example: s[::-1] reverses a string.
